# Middle Temple Library

## An exhibition

The Inns of Court Libraries have enjoyed a long history. This exhibition traces Middle Temple Library from its Tudor conception to its modern day setting, using items from both the Library’s rare book collection and various items from the Archive.

## Origines juridiciales...
or <strong><em>Historical memorials of the English laws, courts of justice, forms of tryall, punishment in cases criminal, law writers, law books, grants and settlements of estates, degree of serjeant, Innes of Court and Chancery. Also a chronologie of the lord chancelors and keepers of the great Seal, lord treasurers, justices itinerant, justices of the Kings Bench and Common Pleas, barons of the Exchequer, masters of the rolls, Kings attorneys and sollicitors, & serjeants at law by William Dugdale Esq; Norroy King of Arms. London : Printed for Christop. Wilkinson, Tho. Dring, and Charles Harper, and are to be sold at their Shops in Fleetstreet, 1680.</em></strong>
<br /><br />
This work is rich with information about the history of English law, lawyers and legal institutions including the Inns of Court, amongst the many other subjects listed in the title, including perhaps the first published rules on English judges’ dress. Dugdale was an antiquary and a herald who visited cathedrals and major churches in London, the midlands, and the north, recording monuments, inscriptions and coats of arms. All editions of this work are filled with engravings and illustrations. He also reprints here (bottom left of page 197) the first mention of the Inn’s library from an anonymous account recorded in a Tudor manuscript (Cotton MS. Vit. C. IX. 35.). This volume was previously owned by Sir James Burrow, a law reporter and Master of the Crown Office.

## Refounding of the Library
<strong><em>The Will of Robert Ashley, 1641</em></strong>
<br /><br />
The Library was officially re-founded by Robert Ashley (1565-1641) when he bequeathed his collection of 5,000 books to the Inn. Ashley was so well-respected at Middle Temple that, although he no longer practiced law, he was allowed to keep his chambers and even extend them to house his large, growing collection of books. He had a wide range of interests and this was reflected in his library: history, politics, medicine, science, astrology, and more, written in mostly Latin, French and Spanish. 
<br /><br />
In his will, Ashley specifies that the collection should be used by any student <strong>“whether of our owne or of any forraigne nation”</strong>. He also set aside £300 for a Keeper of the Books to maintain the Library, thus establishing the position of Librarian at Middle Temple, a position that would be taken up for the first time by the executor of his will, William Cox.

<strong><em>Angliæ notitia: or the present state of England. The first part. Together with divers reflections upon the antient state thereof. By Edward Chamberlayne L.L.D.R.S.S. London : In the Savoy, printed by T.N. for J. Martin, printer to the Royal Society, and are to be sold at the sign of the Bell in S. Pauls Church-Yard, 1679.</em></strong>
<br /><br />
An important historical document, Angliæ notitia is Edward Chamberlayne’s best known work and as the title suggests a guide to the political and social state of England. This was first published in 1669, inspired by a similar work published in 1661, L'Estat Nouveau de la France. 
<br /><br />
This book contains one of the earliest inscriptions (1693) claiming ownership by Middle Temple Library.

## Ashley's Bequest
<strong>An astronomicall description of the late comet from the 18. of Nouemb. 1618. to the 16. of December following. With certaine morall progosticks or applications drawne from the comets motion and irradiation amongst the celestiall hierglyphicks. By vigilant and diligent obseruations of Iohn Bainbridge Doctor of Physicke, and louer of the mathematicks.</strong> London :  Printed by Edward Griffin for Iohn Parker, 1618.
<br /><br />
In 1618 there were three comet sightings visible to the naked eye; for the first time easier to observe than ever before with the invention of the telescope.  Copernicus had caused scandal with his heliocentric model of the galaxy and now further controversy followed with discourse around these comets. The sighting of the Great Comet (C/1618 W1) offered clarity to the nature of these celestial bodies, previously thought to be signs of disaster or sublunar vapours. Along with other observers, John Bainbridge agreed comets were naturally occurring phenomena, not portents of doom (though suggested they could still be divine omens). This work earned him a professorship at Oxford in 1619. 
<br /><br />
This item is part of Robert Ashley's bequest, which contains more non-legal subjects than legal and provides great insight into his wide-ranging interests, and perhaps by extension, the interests of gentleman like him.

## Early Days of the Library

Soon after the bequest, Ashley’s books were moved to the Lower Parliament Chamber, under lock and key, until a Library could be built to accommodate them. It wasn’t until 1650 that a purpose-built Library was constructed. The first official Library space was established in old, converted chambers over the kitchen, in a building then called Garden Building and later renamed No. 2 Garden Court, located to the East side of the Hall. The Library remained in that building for almost 200 years, until the early nineteenth century.
<br /><br />
NOTE:  Buildings around the Inn have changed their names throughout the years. Current day Nos. 1 and 2 Garden Court on the west side of the Hall were originally known as Nos. 3 and 4 Garden Court in the seventeenth century, up until 1824. 
The previous No. 1 Garden Court was originally known as the Barbon’s Buildings, built in 1678 and located south of the Hall, close to the old Temple Steps which gave access to the river Thames. With the new 1832 building, 1 Garden Court became 3 and 4 Plowden Buildings (destroyed during the war), which is approximately where the Library stands today! 



##

<strong>New Parliament Chamber Library</strong>
<br /><br />
By the early nineteenth century, No. 2 Garden Court had become old and dilapidated, having been built in 1625 and apparently not being well kept. Samuel Ireland in Inns of Court, 1800, p.101 commented of the books’ “extreme dirtiness” and The Times (23rd June, 1824) called the Library a “<strong>miserable dirty hole</strong>”.
<br /><br />
In 1824 a new purpose-built Library was gratefully constructed by architect Henry Hakewill. Located in today’s Parliament Chamber, the Library was almost immediately too small to house all the books in the collection. A gallery was built as a temporary measure in 1854, but a more permanent solution was needed.

<strong>1857 Library Committee minutes discussing plans for the new Library’s location, 14 April 1857</strong>
<br /><br />
In 1857, it was finally decided that a new building was required to encompass all the Library’s collections. A number of possible locations were deliberated. These Library Committee minutes show how unpopular the plan to build a new library on the fountain court site was. We can see that it provoked such a stir as to inspire a petition against it, signed by the Inn’s barrister members.
<br /><br />
The final site was ultimately decided with the purchase of new land, known as Essex Wharf and premises (approximately where the Queen Elizabeth building stands today).

## The Gothic Library

Designed in the Neo-Gothic style by architect H.R. Abraham, the Library was opened on the 31st October 1861 by the Royal Bencher of the Inn, the Prince of Wales (later HRH Edward VI). It was 86 feet long, 42 feet in width and able to house up to 60,000 books; the Library was finally able to accommodate its growing collection. 
<br /><br />
The Library had an open hammer-beam roof, imitated to look like Westminster Hall. A ten foot oriel window graced the south side of the building, close to the Thames. It was said that the Library used to be so close to the Thames that the Library porters could open the window and throw breadcrumbs out to feed the ducks. Although this of course changed with the extension of the embankment with the first of the Thames Embankment Acts in 1862. 
<br /><br />
Heraldic glass decoration adorned other windows throughout the Library. You can still see some remaining shards of the stained glass in the cabinet before you enter the Library. Look closely at the photo showing the north side entrance of the Library and you can see the Robert Ashley portrait painted by Thomas Leigh in est. 1565 poking above the bookshelves on the right-hand-side. This portrait still hangs in the Library today.

<strong>Heating the Library, 1860</strong>
<br /><br />
The new building didn’t appease all the members, with some finding the building ‘grotesque’ and others having concern for the oftentimes draughty premises and poor lighting.  
<br /><br />
The Library sought to alleviate these discomforts over the years. We can see from this quote that a brick furnace was to be fixed in the basement in the tower of the building, alongside over 2,500 feet of pipes and a hot water apparatus to heat the Library. We can see these pipes, covered by iron grates, in the photos of the interior of the Library. Whilst this relatively new invention was modern for its time, complaints continued.

##

<strong>Heating the Library, 1928</strong>
<br /><br />
In 1928, the Library decided to upgrade its heating. This quote sets out the changes that were made. The existing high pressure hot water heating installation was converted into an accelerated low pressure hot water system by replacing the furnace with a modern cast iron sectional heating boiler. The original pipes would be used to distribute the water by an electrically driven circulator and 6 36-inch radiators would be fixed throughout the Library, against bookcases and windows. This cost the Library between £221-385.

<strong>Wartime Library [photos]; letter to Miss Woodward of Pump Court</strong>
<br /><br />
The Library suffered immense damage during the Second World War. The area was bombed a number of times, with the Library sustaining some damage early on in the war. This letter from the Librarian to a Miss Woodward of Pump Court details the destruction of the Library during the war and the subsequent removal of 55,000 volumes of books to Bletchley after the initial damage.
<br /><br />
In 1941 a bomb fell that caused the Library roof to cave in and rendered the building no longer safe to use. During this time, Middle Templars were invited to make use of Lincoln’s Inn Library which managed to stay safe during the Blitz.

##

<strong>Temporary Library</strong>
<br /><br />
Soon after the war, a temporary Library was built on the site where Nos. 2 and 3 Brick Court once stood (where the car park is situated today). It was opened 21st November 1946 by the Queen Mother and housed around 50,000 books.

##

<strong>Possible Libraries</strong>
<br /><br />
Prior to the construction of the modern Library, there was the suggestion of a joint Library for the two Inns. However, both Inner and Middle decided against this and Edward Maufe was contracted to design a new Library for Middle Temple.
 <br /><br />
Originally, he designed a six-storey structure to be built on top of the site of the Gothic Library (which would be demolished), however it was agreed this would cost the Inn too much money. Maufe’s second design culminated in the Library you are standing in today. The temporary Library was demolished in 1958 to make way for the car park.

##

<strong>The Ashley Building Library</strong>
<br /><br />
The current Library’s construction was completed in 1958. Once again, the Library was opened by our then royal bencher, the Queen Mother.
 <br /><br />
With wartime damage to the previous building in recent memory, Edward Maufe designed the new Library to be sturdy. It is because of that sturdiness the Inn was able to extend to a fourth floor which opened in 2017.
<br /><br />
The Ashley Library, some members may notice bears some resemblance to the Library at Grays Inn. It is then not surprising that the architect behind both was Edward Maufe.

##

<strong>American Floor</strong>
<br /><br />
In 1954, the Library received a donation of 550 volumes of American law reports and a few other legal texts from the American Government. The Library, to this day, houses the largest US law collection outside of the US. Middle Temple has retained a close connection with the US since the sixteenth century which you can discover more about in our next exhibition about the Declaration of Independence.

## The Collections

<strong>1693-1694 No. 110  16 November 1694 receipt book / The new natura  brevium of the most reverend judge, Mr. Anthony Fitz-herbert</strong>
<br /><br />
Spanning several centuries, the receipt books cover the expenditure of the Inn, making note of things like employees’ wages, bills for coal and feasts, and   payment for acquisitions like furniture and books. The receipt book on display from 1693 shows us a list of books the Library acquired during this period. Whilst donations from generous members of the Inn formed much of the foundation of the Library, these receipt books tell us that Keepers of the Library were intent on shaping the collections and were keen to select core legal texts for its readership.
 <br /><br />
One such acquisition is The new natura brevium of the most reverend judge, Mr. Anthony Fitz-herbert. This treatise on the laws of England, initially printed in 1534, includes commentary on the practical application of writs in use at that time and was even allowed to be cited in court, right up until the eighteenth century. The copy on display is from a later edition. There have been many subsequent editions of this seminal text, including two that can be found on the open shelves at Bay 39 and 42.

## Donations

<strong>The Establish’d State of the Publick Offices under His Majesty King George II. Containing true and exact lists of the Lords of his Majesty’s privy-council. London: Printed for Weaver Bickerton, in Devereux Court, without Temple Bar; and sold by J. Roberts in Warwick-Lane; A. Dodd, without Temple-Bar; E. Nutt, at the Royal-Exchange, T. Green, at Charing-Cross, J. Penn, in Westminster-Hall, and P. Meighan, at Gray’s-Inn Gate, 1718.</strong>
<br /><br />
This list of public offices under King George III is open on a page displaying Masters of the Bench at Inner Temple, Lincoln’s Inn and Middle Temple, as well as the King’s Bench. This work is bound into a volume with seven other       miscellaneous works from the library of amateur historian Edward Sage, who was a Stoke Newington local. Between 1950 and 1951, despite being housed in temporary accommodation, Middle Temple Library accepted numerous items from the Edward Sage bequest from Stoke Newington Library. This particular work not only provides a snapshot of the Inn’s Benchers, but the imprint also paints a vivid picture of bookselling in 1718. An ideal item for Middle Temple’s Library collection.

<strong>Magick & astrology vindicated from those false aspersions and calumnies, which the ignorance of some hath cast upon them. In which is contained true definitions of the said arts, and the justification of their practise, proved by the authority of Scripture, and the experience of ancient and modern authors. With observations from several remarkable conjunctions and apparitions: as those three suns that appeared before the Kings death, &c. Impartially communicated for the publique good. / By Hardick Warren, a well-wisher to the most secret occult arts and learning. Oxford : Clarendon press, 1761.</strong>
<br /><br />
Originally printed in 1651, this is the only known work by hermetic philosopher Hardick Warren. The seventeenth century is known for an interest in the occult, and this particular work attempts to rationalise natural magic, making it       compatible with Warren’s Christian beliefs and distancing it from subjects of dark magic, such as necromancy and consorting with spirits. This item is not unusual at all in our collections, our biggest benefactor Robert Ashley, like many of his contemporaries, also had a taste for books on similar subjects. This work was donated to the Inn in 1698, by Middle Temple member and later Inner Temple Treasurer, William Petyt. Similar to Ashley, Petyt left his collection to Inner Temple with £150 for buying a place to preserve it, which resulted in the Library being enlarged to accommodate the bequest.

The first Library catalogue was produced by William Cox, executor of Ashley’s will and the first Library Keeper, which noted down all the volumes in the collection. Though, sadly, it no longer survives, several catalogues have been produced since, in various forms, including this manuscript on the left.
 <br /><br />
It was started in 1700 and lists all major donations to the library covering 1641-1711, and 1826-1884. The end-leaves have manuscript notes regarding Library Keepers and rules and orders of the library. This manuscript also lists the first printed catalogue (displayed below). It was commissioned by Sir Bartholomew Shower, Treasurer of the Inn in 1700. According to the 'Liber Benefactorum' manuscript (MS 137), this copy was presented to the library in 1834 by Robert Maitland.

<strong>Catalogus librorum bibliothecæ Honorabilis Societatis Medii Templi, Londini. Ordine dictionarii dispositus, 1734</strong>
<br /><br />
Printed in 1734, this catalogue organises the titles into alphabetical order, recording book size (e.g. folio, 8vo, 4to), printing location and date. It provides the locations, denoting the ‘seat and side’ and the shelf number, giving us an idea about how previous librarians classified and shelved the collection. On the pages displayed, we can see various annotations, like general updates and annotations that appear to be correcting printed inaccuracies. Books would’ve been added to the collection on a regular basis, before a new and updated  catalogue would’ve been printed.

<strong>Catalogues</strong>
<br /><br />
This is an example of a catalogue record from the card catalogue that became the norm in the nineteenth century in libraries. You can find the card catalogue on the Gallery before you enter the Library and on the third floor, next to the US collection. Today, the Library uses an online public access catalogue (OPAC) to organise its collections. Scan the QR code to use the catalogue.
