<strong><em>Origines juridiciales, or historical memorials of the English laws, courts of justice, forms of tryall, punishment in cases criminal, law writers, law books, grants and settlements of estates, degree of serjeant, Innes of Court and Chancery. Also a chronologie of the lord chancelors and keepers of the great Seal, lord treasurers, justices itinerant, justices of the Kings Bench and Common Pleas, barons of the Exchequer, masters of the rolls, Kings attorneys and sollicitors, & serjeants at law by William Dugdale Esq; Norroy King of Arms. London : Printed for Christop. Wilkinson, Tho. Dring, and Charles Harper, and are to be sold at their Shops in Fleetstreet, 1680.</em></strong>
<br /><br />
<strong>Origines juridiciales</strong> is rich with information about the history of English law, lawyers and legal institutions including the Inns of Court, amongst the many other subjects listed in the title, including perhaps the first published rules on English judges’ dress. Dugdale was an antiquary and a herald who visited cathedrals and major churches in London, the midlands, and the north, recording monuments, inscriptions and coats of arms. All editions of this work are filled with engravings and illustrations. He also reprints here (bottom left of page 197) the first mention of the Inn’s library from an anonymous account recorded in a Tudor manuscript (Cotton MS. Vit. C. IX. 35.). This volume was previously owned by Sir James Burrow, a law reporter and Master of the Crown Office.

## Refounding of the Library
<strong><em>The Will of Robert Ashley, 1641</em></strong>
<br /><br />
The Library was officially re-founded by Robert Ashley (1565-1641) when he bequeathed his collection of 5,000 books to the Inn. Ashley was so well-respected at Middle Temple that, although he no longer practiced law, he was allowed to keep his chambers and even extend them to house his large, growing collection of books. He had a wide range of interests and this was reflected in his library: history, politics, medicine, science, astrology, and more, written in mostly Latin, French and Spanish. 
<br /><br />
In his will, Ashley specifies that the collection should be used by any student <strong>“whether of our owne or of any forraigne nation”</strong>. He also set aside £300 for a Keeper of the Books to maintain the Library, thus establishing the position of Librarian at Middle Temple, a position that would be taken up for the first time by the executor of his will, William Cox.

<strong><em>Angliæ notitia: or the present state of England. The first part. Together with divers reflections upon the antient state thereof. By Edward Chamberlayne L.L.D.R.S.S. London : In the Savoy, printed by T.N. for J. Martin, printer to the Royal Society, and are to be sold at the sign of the Bell in S. Pauls Church-Yard, 1679.</em></strong>
<br /><br />
An important historical document, Angliæ notitia is Edward Chamberlayne’s best known work and as the title suggests a guide to the political and social state of England. This was first published in 1669, inspired by a similar work published in 1661, L'Estat Nouveau de la France. 
<br /><br />
This book contains one of the earliest inscriptions (1693) claiming ownership by Middle Temple Library.
