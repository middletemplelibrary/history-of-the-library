<strong><em>Origines juridiciales, or historical memorials of the English laws, courts of justice, forms of tryall, punishment in cases criminal, law writers, law books, grants and settlements of estates, degree of serjeant, Innes of Court and Chancery. Also a chronologie of the lord chancelors and keepers of the great Seal, lord treasurers, justices itinerant, justices of the Kings Bench and Common Pleas, barons of the Exchequer, masters of the rolls, Kings attorneys and sollicitors, & serjeants at law by William Dugdale Esq; Norroy King of Arms. London : Printed for Christop. Wilkinson, Tho. Dring, and Charles Harper, and are to be sold at their Shops in Fleetstreet, 1680.</em></strong>
<br /><br />
<strong>Origines juridiciales</strong> is rich with information about the history of English law, lawyers and legal institutions including the Inns of Court, amongst the many other subjects listed in the title, including perhaps the first published rules on English judges’ dress. Dugdale was an antiquary and a herald who visited cathedrals and major churches in London, the midlands, and the north, recording monuments, inscriptions and coats of arms. All editions of this work are filled with engravings and illustrations. He also reprints here (bottom left of page 197) the first mention of the Inn’s library from an anonymous account recorded in a Tudor manuscript (Cotton MS. Vit. C. IX. 35.). This volume was previously owned by Sir James Burrow, a law reporter and Master of the Crown Office.

## Refounding of the Library
<strong><em>The Will of Robert Ashley, 1641</em></strong>
<br /><br />
The Library was officially re-founded by Robert Ashley (1565-1641) when he bequeathed his collection of 5,000 books to the Inn. Ashley was so well-respected at Middle Temple that, although he no longer practiced law, he was allowed to keep his chambers and even extend them to house his large, growing collection of books. He had a wide range of interests and this was reflected in his library: history, politics, medicine, science, astrology, and more, written in mostly Latin, French and Spanish. 
<br /><br />
In his will, Ashley specifies that the collection should be used by any student <strong>“whether of our owne or of any forraigne nation”</strong>. He also set aside £300 for a Keeper of the Books to maintain the Library, thus establishing the position of Librarian at Middle Temple, a position that would be taken up for the first time by the executor of his will, William Cox.

<strong><em>Angliæ notitia: or the present state of England. The first part. Together with divers reflections upon the antient state thereof. By Edward Chamberlayne L.L.D.R.S.S. London : In the Savoy, printed by T.N. for J. Martin, printer to the Royal Society, and are to be sold at the sign of the Bell in S. Pauls Church-Yard, 1679.</em></strong>
<br /><br />
An important historical document, Angliæ notitia is Edward Chamberlayne’s best known work and as the title suggests a guide to the political and social state of England. This was first published in 1669, inspired by a similar work published in 1661, L'Estat Nouveau de la France. 
<br /><br />
This book contains one of the earliest inscriptions (1693) claiming ownership by Middle Temple Library.

## Ashley's Bequest
<strong>An astronomicall description of the late comet from the 18. of Nouemb. 1618. to the 16. of December following. With certaine morall progosticks or applications drawne from the comets motion and irradiation amongst the celestiall hierglyphicks. By vigilant and diligent obseruations of Iohn Bainbridge Doctor of Physicke, and louer of the mathematicks.</strong> London :  Printed by Edward Griffin for Iohn Parker, 1618.
<br /><br />
In 1618 there were three comet sightings visible to the naked eye; for the first time easier to observe than ever before with the invention of the telescope.  Copernicus had caused scandal with his heliocentric model of the galaxy and now further controversy followed with discourse around these comets. The sighting of the Great Comet (C/1618 W1) offered clarity to the nature of these celestial bodies, previously thought to be signs of disaster or sublunar vapours. Along with other observers, John Bainbridge agreed comets were naturally occurring phenomena, not portents of doom (though suggested they could still be divine omens). This work earned him a professorship at Oxford in 1619. 
<br /><br />
This item is part of Robert Ashley's bequest, which contains more non-legal subjects than legal and provides great insight into his wide-ranging interests, and perhaps by extension, the interests of gentleman like him.

## Early Days of the Library

Soon after the bequest, Ashley’s books were moved to the Lower Parliament Chamber, under lock and key, until a Library could be built to accommodate them. It wasn’t until 1650 that a purpose-built Library was constructed. The first official Library space was established in old, converted chambers over the kitchen, in a building then called Garden Building and later renamed No. 2 Garden Court, located to the East side of the Hall. The Library remained in that building for almost 200 years, until the early nineteenth century.
<br /><br />
NOTE:  Buildings around the Inn have changed their names throughout the years. Current day Nos. 1 and 2 Garden Court on the west side of the Hall were originally known as Nos. 3 and 4 Garden Court in the seventeenth century, up until 1824. 
The previous No. 1 Garden Court was originally known as the Barbon’s Buildings, built in 1678 and located south of the Hall, close to the old Temple Steps which gave access to the river Thames. With the new 1832 building, 1 Garden Court became 3 and 4 Plowden Buildings (destroyed during the war), which is approximately where the Library stands today!

<strong>New Parliament Chamber Library</strong>
<br /><br />
By the early nineteenth century, No. 2 Garden Court had become old and dilapidated, having been built in 1625 and apparently not being well kept. Samuel Ireland in Inns of Court, 1800, p.101 commented of the books’ “extreme dirtiness” and The Times (23rd June, 1824) called the Library a “<strong>miserable dirty hole</strong>”.
<br /><br />
In 1824 a new purpose-built Library was gratefully constructed by architect Henry Hakewill. Located in today’s Parliament Chamber, the Library was almost immediately too small to house all the books in the collection. A gallery was built as a temporary measure in 1854, but a more permanent solution was needed.

<strong>1857 Library Committee minutes discussing plans for the new Library’s location, 14 April 1857</strong>
<br /><br />
In 1857, it was finally decided that a new building was required to encompass all the Library’s collections. A number of possible locations were deliberated. These Library Committee minutes show how unpopular the plan to build a new library on the fountain court site was. We can see that it provoked such a stir as to inspire a petition against it, signed by the Inn’s barrister members.
<br /><br />
The final site was ultimately decided with the purchase of new land, known as Essex Wharf and premises (approximately where the Queen Elizabeth building stands today).

## The Gothic Library

Designed in the Neo-Gothic style by architect H.R. Abraham, the Library was opened on the 31st October 1861 by the Royal Bencher of the Inn, the Prince of Wales (later HRH Edward VI). It was 86 feet long, 42 feet in width and able to house up to 60,000 books; the Library was finally able to accommodate its growing collection. 
<br /><br />
The Library had an open hammer-beam roof, imitated to look like Westminster Hall. A ten foot oriel window graced the south side of the building, close to the Thames. It was said that the Library used to be so close to the Thames that the Library porters could open the window and throw breadcrumbs out to feed the ducks. Although this of course changed with the extension of the embankment with the first of the Thames Embankment Acts in 1862. 
<br /><br />
Heraldic glass decoration adorned other windows throughout the Library. You can still see some remaining shards of the stained glass in the cabinet before you enter the Library. Look closely at the photo showing the north side entrance of the Library and you can see the Robert Ashley portrait painted by Thomas Leigh in est. 1565 poking above the bookshelves on the right-hand-side. This portrait still hangs in the Library today.

<strong>Heating the Library, 1860</strong>
<br /><br />
The new building didn’t appease all the members, with some finding the building ‘grotesque’ and others having concern for the oftentimes draughty premises and poor lighting.  
<br /><br />
The Library sought to alleviate these discomforts over the years. We can see from this quote that a brick furnace was to be fixed in the basement in the tower of the building, alongside over 2,500 feet of pipes and a hot water apparatus to heat the Library. We can see these pipes, covered by iron grates, in the photos of the interior of the Library. Whilst this relatively new invention was modern for its time, complaints continued.

<strong>Heating the Library, 1928</strong>
<br /><br />
In 1928, the Library decided to upgrade its heating. This quote sets out the changes that were made. The existing high pressure hot water heating installation was converted into an accelerated low pressure hot water system by replacing the furnace with a modern cast iron sectional heating boiler. The original pipes would be used to distribute the water by an electrically driven circulator and 6 36-inch radiators would be fixed throughout the Library, against bookcases and windows. This cost the Library between £221-385.
